#### Projects
* **Cornell Baja SAE – Custom Differential Casing**
  *Design and analysis of a custom Torsen-B parallel-axis differential casing for the TG22 Baja car*

  * Designed and fabricated every component of the TG21 Baja car’s 4WD system, including a carbon fiber driveshaft
  * Reduced 1.8 lbs off the Baja car by redesigning the casing to be made of aluminum instead of steel, using a sleeved geometry
  * Created a high-scope multi-body FEA model (over 20 bodies) in order to analyze stresses on the differential casing


* **Cornell Baja SAE – 4WD Drivetrain System**
  *Design and manufacture of a complete four-wheel-drive system for an off-road race vehicle*

  * Designed and fabricated every component of the TG21 Baja car’s 4WD system, including a carbon fiber driveshaft
  * Reduced subsystem mass by 15% through iterative FEA-driven geometry optimization
  * Improved serviceability by redesigning bonded joints into a splined yoke assembly

* **Cornell Baja SAE – Rear Suspension System**
  *Design and fabrication of rear dual A-arm suspension*

  * Designed suspension arms and welding fixtures to maintain tight tolerances
  * Contributed to 1st Place Suspension at Baja SAE California and 2nd Place Iron Team (2024)
