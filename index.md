## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpeg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a senior mechanical engineering undergrad student at Cornell University, with a strong focus on mechanical design, manufacturing, and applied analysis. My interests center on designing hardware that must function reliably under real-world constraints—high loads, tight tolerances, and aggressive performance targets. I am particularly drawn to drivetrain systems, structural design, and manufacturing-driven engineering, where analytical rigor and hands-on execution are inseparable. Across coursework, team leadership, and industry experience, I have consistently sought roles that place me close to the hardware, from early-stage design through fabrication, assembly, and validation.
Previously, I have worked as an engineering intern at SpaceX, where I performed load calculations and designed lift and transport solutions for ultra-heavy aerospace hardware, including custom structures used to move Starship and Super Heavy. I have also worked in a small, fast-moving automotive environment at Blackbridge Motors, designing custom components and full vehicle assemblies to support scalable production of resto-mod vehicles. Outside of industry, I serve as a team lead on Cornell Baja SAE, where I have designed and manufactured critical vehicle subsystems—including a lightweight 4WD drivetrain—while logging hundreds of hours on CNC mills and lathes. These experiences have shaped my approach to engineering: practical, detail-oriented, and grounded in the realities of manufacturing and system integration.
