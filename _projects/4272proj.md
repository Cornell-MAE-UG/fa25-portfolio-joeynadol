This project involved the design, fabrication, and experimental testing of small-scale wind turbine blades optimized for safe operation and power extraction under constrained operating conditions. The blades were designed for a target rotational speed of 1500 RPM at a mean free-stream velocity of 4.59 m/s, informed by a Weibull wind-speed distribution. Safety considerations dominated the design process, with flapwise bending failure and torque brake–induced runaway identified as the primary risks. To mitigate these risks, a conservative blade length of 4 inches was selected, resulting in factors of safety of 1.24 against torque brake failure and approximately 10 against flapwise bending at worst-case wind conditions.

Aerodynamic optimization was performed using the NACA 4412 airfoil at a Reynolds number near 50,000. Based on published lift-to-drag data, the blade twist distribution was designed to maintain an angle of attack of approximately 8.5°, corresponding to maximum aerodynamic efficiency for this airfoil. While this approach ensured stable and predictable aerodynamic behavior, the conservative geometric constraints significantly limited the maximum achievable torque and power output relative to theoretical expectations.

Experimental testing was conducted in a wind tunnel at three free-stream velocities: 4.3 m/s, 5.5 m/s, and 6.1 m/s. For each case, torque and power were measured as functions of rotational speed using incremental torque brake loading. Peak power was observed at approximately 800 RPM, 1100 RPM, and 1250 RPM, respectively, with higher wind speeds shifting the optimal operating point upward in RPM. Although the peak power levels were substantially lower than predicted and consistently occurred below the design target of 1500 RPM, the observed trends aligned with expected turbine scaling behavior. No structural damage or deformation was observed during testing.
The discrepancy between theoretical and experimental performance was primarily attributed to unmodeled internal friction and parasitic losses within the drivetrain. The turbine required significantly higher wind speeds than expected to overcome breakaway torque, indicating that static and velocity-dependent friction dominated system behavior at higher RPMs. While experimental results closely matched theoretical predictions at low rotational speeds, divergence increased as rotational speed rose and frictional losses became more significant. Overall, the project demonstrated the importance of incorporating real system losses into aerodynamic and performance models and highlighted the trade-off between conservative safety-driven design and achievable power output.
